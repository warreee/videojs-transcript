00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360
Okay now for the grand finale, we're going to answer the kind of questions you will get as a data scientist.

2
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.120
We'll be using each of the techniques shown in this

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.560
video to complete the case study.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.920
Here is an example of how we calculated an average in an exercise from Chapter 3.

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.880
We began by importing the select statement.

8
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.800
Next we built a select statement that creates a weighted average.

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.680
We do this by summing the result of multiplying the age with the population and

10
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.720
dividing that by the sum of the total population and labeling that average age.

11
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.640
Next we grouped by the sex column to determine the average age for each sex.

12
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.400
Finally, we executed the query and fetched all the results.


15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.280
We learned how to calculate a percentage by using the case and cast clauses in Chapter 3.

16
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.680
We being by importing case, cast, and Float then we build a select statement

17
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.960
that calculates the sum of the pop2008 column in cases where the state is New York.

18
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.600
Then we divided that by the sum of the total population which is cast to a Float so we would get Decimal values.

19
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.400
Finally, we multiplyed by 100 to get a percentages and labeled it ny_percent.


22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.560
Also from Chapter 3, we learned how calculate the difference between two columns grouped by another column.

23
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.840
We start by building a select statement, that selects the

24
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.200
column we want to determine the change by, which in this case is age.

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.280
Then we calculate the difference between the population in 2008 and in 2000, and we label that pop_change.

26
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.240
Remember to wrap the difference calculation in parenthesis so you can label it.

27
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.200
Next, we order by pop_change and finally we limit it to just 5 results.



30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.760
Now it's your turn to use these techniques in the case study.



33
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.240
Good luck!
