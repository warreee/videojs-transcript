00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Okay now for the grand finale, we're going to answer

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,360
the kind of questions you will get as a data scientist.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,120
We'll be using each of the techniques shown in this

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,800
video to complete the case study.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:12,800


6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:12,800


7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,840
Here is an example of how we calculated an average in an exercise from Chapter 3.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,880
We began by importing the select statement.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,160
Next we built a select statement that creates a weighted average.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,640
We do this by summing the result of multiplying the age with the population and

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,680
dividing that by the sum of the total population and labeling that average age.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,640
Next we grouped by the sex column to determine the average age for each sex.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,360
Finally, we executed the query and fetched all the results.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,360


15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,400


16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,280
We learned how to calculate a percentage by using the case and cast clauses in Chapter 3.

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
We being by importing case, cast, and Float then we build a select statement

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,960
that calculates the sum of the pop2008 column in cases where the state is New York.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,400
Then we divided that by the sum of the total population

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,600
which is cast to a Float so we would get Decimal values.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,400
Finally, we multiplyed by 100 to get a percentages and labeled it ny_percent.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,400


23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,400


24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Also from Chapter 3, we learned how calculate the

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,600
difference between two columns grouped by another column.

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,840
We start by building a select statement, that selects the

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,200
column we want to determine the change by, which in this case is age.

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,720
Then we calculate the difference between the

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,280
population in 2008 and in 2000, and we label that pop_change.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,240
Remember to wrap the difference calculation in parenthesis so you can label it.

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,200
Next, we order by pop_change and finally we limit it to just 5 results.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,200


33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,200


34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,720
Now it's your turn to use these techniques in the case study.

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,120


36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,120


37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,240
Good luck!
